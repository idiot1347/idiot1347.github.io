## Welcome to my website!

### Inline

We can render inline math like $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$ by surrounding the MathJax markup with single dollar symbols like so: `$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$`.

### Block

To generate standalone blocks of math, add double dollar symbols on new lines before and after the markup.

    $$
    P(E)   = {n \choose k} p^k (1-p)^{ n-k}
    $$

$$
P(E)   = {n \choose k} p^k (1-p)^{ n-k}
$$
